0,Warning Everyone: Phone is Overheating like hell,"I just received my Oneplus Pro 9 12Gb/256GB Model, guess what I dint even finish setting up the phone the Phone is OVERHEATING and showing a message that Phone is Overheated. Oneplus is this your premium Phone??? COMMON... I am very disappointed buying this. I initially thought my phone might be defective, but i researched more about this, I found a Forum Thread in Oneplus Website where everyone is complaining of Over Heating issues. You cannot even record a 4k video for 60 sec, phone overheats and stops the recording. Forget 8K recording.. Just read the thread in OnePlus Forum, others cannot even click photo, phone overheats and stops the camera... What is this ONEPLUS? You better release an software update and fix this mess. This is not expected from premium phone like this. I will not change One Star until you fix this Over Heating issue.

4,Warp charge with Warp drain,"I know that with so much competition, its more about marketing than actual product. My only expectations were a good camera, high performance processor and a long battery life. Since I was switching from Oneplus 5, the camera system and the performance was a good upgrade for me. BUT unfortunately the battery was way out of expectation. Fully charged at 09.25am, it died at 16:49pm under low usage. I didn't install any demanding apps or games. Also the back side was pretty warm all of the time, even when not doing anything. Before that day I left the phone at 50% while going to sleep and in the morning it was 38%. Its definitely a defect with such a low standby time for a new device. There's no point in 30 minutes fast charge if the drain is that fast. In two days of using the device I had to charge it 3 times. It could be a defect on my unit only but unfortunately I had to return it. I could have waited to see if an update could solve it but just didn't want to end up in the service center fiasco. Everybody knows how after sales service works in India. Lets wait more to see if others complain about the same too.",05 Apr 2021,"Style name: 12GB RAM, 256GB Storage Colour: Stellar Black","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61pOI8R8vOL._SY88.jpg

7,OnePlus Disappointment Pro. Fake marketing for camera. Useless camera. Hasselblad is a hassle,"Disappointment continues with OnePlus 9 pro too. Phones made after OnePlus 5T are simply not worth the cost. 1. Very poor quality camera. Samsung camera is way way better than this one. Camera hype is all fake and useless. There is no hardware improvement in camera since OnePlus 5t. Colors are a bit richer, but that is not what we wanted. We wanted better resolution nad zooming capacity, which is absolutely not there. Hasselblad partnership is useless. 2. Extreme Overheating issues. I cannot take a video more than 1 min in 4k 120 fps & more than 2-2.5 mins. In 4k 60 fps or 2k 60/120 fps. Phone immediately heats up and tells you that temperature is very high and screen goes dark. India is a country where temperatures go close to 50 degrees in summers in many areas. This just won't work in india this way. After 1 min the recording stops and phone shuts down. 3. Pictures are like what I could take back in 2015 with OnePlus 5T. The only improvement is contrast and nothing else. 4. Battery is also not good. It drains from 100 % to 57 % in just 1 hour of watching videos on you tube. And if you play any games on it, it will die and also phone will hear up very badly. Go for samsung phones instead. There is no returning this phone once purchased.

8,Not worth 70K,"The phone hangs and there is No back button in this. So, the apps do not close properly. The battery backup is not good at all if you are constantly on net. You play a you tube video and sometimes, even you close the video, the music keeps on running in the backend till you have to switch off the phone to stop that music. When you wake up the phone, the light flickering issue is there. Video call experience is not that great. Not happy with it's performance.

9,Heating issues. Don't buy,Very disappointed at the heating issues. Wouldn't recommend buying this. I bought this on the first release date itself and was super excited to get my hands on it. Phone gets heated a lot even with basic operations and battery gets drained quickly too. Same issue is being experienced by everyone else too.. just google oneplus9 heating issues! Don't buy until they address this issue.

10,Very huge hype and Biggest disappointed Smartphone,After using 3 days I am writing this review briefly. Pros: Sound quality is good and 65w warp charge is marvelous and camera is good but not too good. Cons: Battery draining very fast whether using or not using the mobile. Mobile heating is very high in normal usage and mid day condition and also due to whether Mobile heating is very high and if we keep idle also mobile not gets cool.This is biggest disappointment. Some time gets over heat we cannot Take photos and its shows warning message. Conclusion: I am totally disappointed this onePlus 9pro mobile and its not worth for 70k bugs.,04 Apr 2021,"Style name: 12GB RAM, 256GB Storage Colour: Pine Green",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1K0p63Ko3L._SY88.jpg,Yes,NANTHAKUMAR,2.0,"OnePlus 9 Pro 5G (Morning Mist, 12GB RAM, 256GB Storage) I Extra INR4000 off on coupons",https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive_2020_1167-Multi-3GB-Storage/product-reviews/B089MV3MVY/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews,Positive Comment,Positive Comment,Positive Comment
11,"Amazing potential, disappointing launch quality.","I feel like early buyers are essentially being used as beta testers by OnePlus. And I will explain why. When you look at the specs this phone is no doubt a flagship. They have also improved the cameras, where they were previously lacking. Even with all the bugs on launch, the photos taken on this phone are just delicious! Low light photography is mind-blowing. The custom sensor they made with Sony is doing its job. The ""natural color science"" that they worked on with Hasselblad is also showing some results... skin tones in photos taken with this look much more realistic compared to other phones at this range (S21 or iPhone). So its definitely not just for marketing. So why did I give it such a low rating? I would have given it 4/5 stars, if it weren't for the insane overheating issues. On the first day, it got really hot (almost 50 degrees) while setting it up. I thought this might have been just because of all the data restoration that was taking place. But afterwards, while I was checking out the camera, it started overheating again and I got a warning within 5 minutes! The phone blocked me from taking any more photos till it had cooled down again. Keep in mind I was not even taking 4k videos, just some casual photos. I tried this after removing the case but it was still happening. Because of this reason alone I have given 2 stars, since there's no point of such amazing cameras if you can't use them for more than 5 mins straight! I have raised this issue to OnePlus, following which they replied with lengthy steps to collect logs from my device while it was overheating. So now I feel like I have unwittingly become a beta tester just for buying it early. Hopefully they can fix this with a software update (I believe one good thing about OnePlus is they always listen to their users). If they do I will increase my rating. EDIT: There has been multiple software updates since my last review, and I'm glad to say that the issues have been mostly fixed! It still warms up slightly when using camera, but I guess this is the case with all devices using Snapdragon 888 chip. However, there has not been an incident of the phone blocking me from using camera, so that's great! Currently I'm on OS version 11.2.4.4. I have increased the rating from 2 to 4 :)",06 Apr 2021,"Style name: 12GB RAM, 256GB Storage Colour: Pine Green","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/818weVr8gdL._SY88.jpg
